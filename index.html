                <h2>What's In a Name: The Difference Between Java and JavaScript</h2>
                <p class="byline">September 27, 2022 | BY JAMILLA MORGAN</p>

                <p>Circa 2021 when I began to study Computer Science at the undergraduate level, I began to hear
                    foreign terms such as Node, React, and sleep. Two terms that I heard even more often,
                    however, were Java and JavaScript. Fun fact: they aren't the same. Let's learn the
                    difference.
                    <br><br>
                    According to GeeksforGeeks, "JavaScript is a lightweight programming language (“scripting
                    language”) and is used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML."
                    Java, on the other hand, is "an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine
                    platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform." While
                    Java can stand alone as a programming language, JavaScript is contained within a webpage and
                    integrates with its HTML content. Another difference is that, "Java applications can run in any
                    virtual machine(JVM) or browser, while JavaScript code used to run only in the browser, but (can
                    now) run on the server via Node.js."
                    <br><br>
                    Well, now we know the difference. Hope that helped. See you next week for another look at my
                    intrusive thoughts.

                <h2>Why I Still Write (Even Though I'm a Web Developer)</h2>
                <p class="byline">August 13, 2022 | BY JAMILLA MORGAN</p>
                <br>
                <img class="notepad" src="images-lab2/Notepad.jpg" alt="Image of a notepad">
                <p>Reading has always been my passion. I have always enjoyed crafting worlds in my imagination as I
                    read novels from a variety of genres. Sometimes, however, I was completely dissatisfied with the
                    way the writer shaped the story. This led me to thinking, "Why don't I write my own stories?"
                    And so I did. I started writing stories, then poems and even songs. I even won a few local
                    competitions for my writing.
                    <br><br>
                    The question then remains: why would I continue to write when I am already involved in as
                    lucrative a career as web development? The answer: I love writing. It's as simple as that.
                    Sometimes we forget that life isn't all about money. If we take the time to pause and examine
                    our surroundings, we will see so much beauty and find so much peace in God's creation. We don't
                    need to be part of the "hustle culture", where we forget about everything and everyone we love
                    in search of financial wealth. Be encouraged today and go pick up that hobby that gave you
                    meaning and peace today.
